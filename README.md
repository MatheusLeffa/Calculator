# A Calculator made in HTML and JavaScript!
A totally raw HTML and JS calculator, simple and objective.

## Porpose & Upgrades
This calculator is a college work I had to do for my algorithms and programming course.

As my first HTML project, I think I've done a good job, but I know it's "raw" without CSS, so I'll refine this project while training my CSS skills with it.

That said, I'll update this project with CSS in the future, and when I feel it's good, I'll share it.

### About the comments
As I'm a brazilian College student, my work was commented in PT-BR. And some parts of my code are in PT-BR also ðŸ˜…. If someone want the code commented in english, please ask me.
